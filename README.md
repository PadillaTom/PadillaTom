## Roadmap
**1) FrontEndJourney-HTML-CSS:** Here i started my journey, learning the basics. With some theory and practical exercices i've got to my second stage!\
**2) Through **P1** to **P6**:** You will find all my Website Projects.\
Fom P1 to P3 I will apply all the knowledge with some design.\
From P4 to P6 I am just practicing the Flexbox and Grid Layouts, without paying much attention to design.\
**3)FrontEndJourney-JS:** Once again I am happy to continue my studies with John Smilga!\
This time with JavaScript. Starting with the Basics then applying them into the DOM.\
**4)FrontEndJourney-DOM-Projects:** Most important --> Traversing the DOM / Selectors inside and Element / To-do App / Image Carousel / NavBar and SideBar.\
**5)FrontEndJourney-JS:** Once done with DOM Projects, I continue with OBJECTS.
